  bio: `I'm an AI-first technologist with a decade of experience driving innovation at the intersection of artificial intelligence, data, IoT, and robotics. My journey spans startups, enterprise tech, and academia — all connected by one mission: using technology to solve real-world problems and empower people through systems, tools, and education.

Currently, I architect Agentic AI systems and Human-in-the-Loop pipelines using LangGraph, OpenAI GPT-4o, and FastAPI. I've successfully deployed production systems achieving 98% accuracy in financial reconciliation and built AI assistants integrated with real-world business operations.

I'm seeking opportunities in AI Engineering, Solutions Architecture, or hybrid roles that connect technology with business impact.`,
