Jeswin Arul,Samuel,,,Nov 23,AI & Data Professional |  GenAI & ML Specialist | Deep Learning | LLMs | RAG | Quicksight | Python | SQL | MSc Artificial Intelligence | Ex-Amazon | Robotics | IoT | Business Transformation | Business Intelligence,"I'm an AI-first technologist with a decade of experience driving innovation at the intersection of artificial intelligence, data, IoT, and robotics. My journey spans startups, enterprise tech, and academia — all connected by one mission: using technology to solve real-world problems and empower people through systems, tools, and education.  At Amazon Luxembourg, I worked as a Business Intelligence Engineer Intern, where I developed a customs audit system that automated 99% of trade record checks using Quicksight dashboards and SQL logic. I also designed data schemas for international trade brokers and implemented multi-layer data validation, improving data quality from 38% to 87%.  In 2022, I moved to Paris to pursue my MSc in Artificial Intelligence for Business Transformation (SKEMA & ESIEA) and Post Graduate Diploma in International Business. My thesis focused on learning behavior on e-learning platforms, tying my interests in AI and EdTech.  Before masters, I built and delivered AI, ML, and IoT training programs at Lema Labs (IIT Madras incubated). I trained and mentored 3000+ students, with over 30% winning in hackathons and robotics competitions. I led curriculum development in Machine Learning, built digital learning products using SCORM and Adobe Suite, and deployed them on a custom LMS I built on OpenEDX during the COVID pivot.  I also co-founded and led the Lema Community, a makerspace where we ran 36-hour makeathons and connected aspiring engineers to industry mentors. I wore many hats — trainer, curriculum designer, hiring manager, business developer, and mentor.  After Lema, I joined Informatica as a Senior Curriculum Developer, building global training content on enterprise data tools like PowerCenter, IDQ, and MDM using Articulate Rise and traditional ILT materials.  Currently, I’m deep into Generative AI, LLMs, RAG pipelines, chatbots, vector databases, and agentic workflows. I also train professionals and students in modern AI, data analytics, and applied statistics.  I'm seeking opportunities in AI Engineering, Data Engineering, or hybrid roles that connect tech with business.
